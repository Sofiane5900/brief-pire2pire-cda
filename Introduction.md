# **Introduction pire2pire**

I’m going to present the security strategy for the online course website pire2pire.com. Website security should be considered during the design phase and not just implemented during development. In this presentation, we will focus on different popular approaches to securing web applications.

Defense in depth**,** is an multi-layered approach to which aims to protect with multiple security mechanisms at different levels, the global idea is that if a layer of security is vulnerable, the others layers continue to provide protection.

The defense in depth is mainly used to protect applications and web-site against a wide range of attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc…

Attack Surface Reduction, is about minimizing the number of potential entry points that attackers can exploit in an application or a web-site; the fewer exposed components, the lower the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.

This strategy is mainly used to protect applications and websites by limiting unnecessary functionalities, restricting API access, and disabling unused services to reduce exposure to attacks such as unauthorized access.


While Defense in Depth and Attack Surface Reduction focus on preventing attacks and minimizing exposure, security is not just about technical protections. Protecting user data is equally critical, which is why regulatory frameworks like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) exist.

The GDPR ensures that personal data is handled securely, transparently, and with user consent, reducing risks related to data breaches, unauthorized use, and privacy violations.

By combining GDPR**, **Defense in Depth**, **and** **Attack Surface Reduction, we build a strong security strategy that helps protect pire2pire.com from attacks while ensuring that user data is handled safely and transparently.
